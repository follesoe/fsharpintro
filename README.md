# Introduction to F# - Exploratory Programming using Type Providers #

This repository contains code examples from my presentation. The examples are available as stand-alone F# script files. Some of the script files depend on external data or libraries. 

To download external dependencies - issue the following NuGet command:

```
.nuget\NuGet.exe install packages.config -o Packages
```
