# Introduction to F# #

This repository contains code examples from my Introduction to F# Programming presentation given at Oslo Functional Programming Day Dec 17. The examples are available as stand-alone F# script files. Some of the script files depend on external data or libraries. 

To download external dependencies - issue the following NuGet command:

```
.nuget\NuGet.exe install packages.config -o Packages
```

The slides from the presentation are available at [http://follesoe.github.com/fsharpintro](http://follesoe.github.com/fsharpintro).
